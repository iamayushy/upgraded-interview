// Any function that is passed as an argument to another function
// is called as callback function

/*
1. They can be synchronous or async
2. Used to fetch data
3. Issue of callback hell

*/

/*
A function which accepts a function as an arguments
or returns a fuction is called a higher order function
*/

/*
if the function depends on the older function then it gets
deeply nested in order to solve it use promises.
